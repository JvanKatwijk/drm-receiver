Redesign and re-implementation of the drm decoder
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

DRM (Digital Radio Mondiale) is - as the name suggests - a form of digital
radio. 
In Europe drm is not very popular, most transmissions that started
in the first decade of the century already stopped. However,
Rumenia still has a regular DRM transmission.

The drm receiver is an experimental tool, a heavily reduced swradio,
with a single decoder, just for drm.
